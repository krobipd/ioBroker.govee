Control all [Govee](https://www.govee.com/) WiFi products from ioBroker — lights, sensors and appliances. Bluetooth-only devices are not supported.

The adapter uses every channel Govee offers and picks whichever delivers the fastest, most reliable answer:

- **LAN** (UDP) — primary for lights with LAN mode enabled
- **AWS IoT MQTT** — real-time status push when you supply your Govee account
- **OpenAPI MQTT** — push events for sensors and appliances (lackWater, iceFull etc.)
- **Cloud REST v2** — capabilities, scenes, control fallback
- **App API** — sensor readings (Govee's OpenAPI v2 returns empty for thermometers, the App API doesn't)

The Wiki lists every supported model and its test status:

## Features

- **Capability-driven** — states are generated from what the Govee API reports for each device. No SKU hardcoding, no hand-maintained device list to fall behind.
- **LAN-first for lights** — UDP multicast discovery, sub-50 ms commands, status updates via AWS IoT MQTT
- **Cloud + MQTT push for sensors and appliances** — readings via the App API, events via the OpenAPI MQTT broker
- **Per-segment color and brightness** for LED strips with the right capability, including batch commands and an interactive segment detection wizard for cut strips
- **Scenes, DIY scenes, music mode, gradient toggle** — activated locally via BLE-over-LAN where possible, Cloud fallback otherwise
- **Cloud and local snapshots** — Govee-app snapshots and ioBroker-side snapshots side by side
- **Groups** — bridge Govee groups into ioBroker with capability intersection across members
- **Diagnostics export button per device** — one-click JSON dump for bug reports
- **Graceful degradation** — works LAN-only without any credentials; each tier unlocks more
- **Rate-limited Cloud usage** — daily and per-minute budgets aligned to Govee's quota

---

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- ioBroker js-controller >= 7.0.7
- ioBroker Admin >= 7.8.23
- A Govee account and at least one Govee WiFi device. LAN control needs a light with LAN mode enabled in the Govee Home app — see Govee's [LAN-supported device list](https://app-h5.govee.com/user-manual/wlan-guide).

## Credential levels

| Level               | Credentials      | What works                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LAN only**        | none             | Lights with LAN mode: power, brightness, color, color temperature, local snapshots                                                               |
| **+ Cloud API key** | API key          | + device names, capabilities, scenes, segments, Cloud snapshots, basic groups, sensor and appliance readings, push events for sensors/appliances |
| **+ Govee account** | email + password | + real-time status push for lights via AWS IoT MQTT, full group control                                                                          |

Sensors and appliances always need at least the API key — they have no LAN protocol. See the [Setup page](https://github.com/krobipd/ioBroker.govee-smart/wiki/Setup) for how to get one.

## Ports

| Port | Protocol | Direction                            | Purpose              |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 4001 | UDP      | Outbound (multicast 239.255.255.250) | LAN device discovery |
| 4002 | UDP      | Inbound                              | LAN device responses |
| 4003 | UDP      | Outbound                             | LAN device commands  |

All ports are fixed by the Govee LAN protocol and cannot be changed.

## Device tiers

Each device shows where its model sits in the catalogue under `diag.tier`:

| Tier         | Meaning                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **verified** | Confirmed on real hardware — known per-SKU corrections active.                                                                     |
| **reported** | Community-reported, treated as verified.                                                                                           |
| **seed**     | Beta. Known per-SKU corrections only apply when **Enable experimental device support** is on in adapter settings.                  |
| **unknown**  | The model isn't in the catalogue yet. Press `diag.export` on the device and post the resulting JSON in a GitHub issue so it can be added. |

The adapter writes one log line per model on startup if the model is `seed` (without the toggle) or `unknown` — once per startup, not on every reconnect.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues (no devices discovered, empty scenes dropdown, segment colors not changing, limited group commands, delayed status updates) are covered on the Wiki [Behavior](https://github.com/krobipd/ioBroker.govee-smart/wiki/Behavior) / [Verhalten](https://github.com/krobipd/ioBroker.govee-smart/wiki/Verhalten) page.

For anything else, press **`diag.export`** on the affected device, copy the JSON from `diag.result`, and open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/krobipd/ioBroker.govee-smart/issues).

---

## Acknowledgments

This adapter's MQTT authentication and BLE-over-LAN (ptReal) protocol implementation was informed by research from [govee2mqtt](https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt) by Wez Furlong. Their reverse-engineering of the Govee AWS IoT MQTT protocol and undocumented API endpoints was invaluable.

## Changelog
### **WORK IN PROGRESS**

- Documentation: changelog entries (v2.5.x–v2.6.0) restored to English — a few bullets had been left in German. No code changes.

### 2.6.0 (2026-05-06)

- Multi-language: info/warn/error logs and state names/descriptions are now in your ioBroker system language (11 languages). Debug logs and stack traces stay English.

### 2.5.4 (2026-05-04)

- Test-coverage expansion: `mqtt.connect` is now an injectable constructor parameter (like `httpsRequest` in v2.5.1), and 7 new mock tests cover the getIotKey path and persisted-credentials reuse.

### 2.5.3 (2026-05-04)

- Segment-detection wizard no longer spams "has no existing object" WARN for indices above the real strip length — echo packets are filtered against `segmentCount` (Issue #8).
- Command before cloud-init (e.g. cloud-only device right after restart) is silent now instead of warning "No channel available".

### 2.5.2 (2026-05-04)

- Stops the `groups.*.info.membersUnreachable` WARN spam every 2 min — the group state stays present with an empty value when all members are reachable instead of being deleted/recreated.
- Verified H61A8 Outdoor Neon LED Strip 10m (reported by tukey42 in Issue #11).

### 2.5.1 (2026-05-04)

- Cloud rate-limit hint now reads "rate-limited by Govee" on 429 instead of the generic cloud-error message. Plus 33 mock tests for cloud + MQTT login paths.

Older entries are in [CHANGELOG_OLD.md](CHANGELOG_OLD.md).
